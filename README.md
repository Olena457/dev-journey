## Screenshots

Below are six screenshots of the project.  
They are stored in the `public/screen/` folder and adapt responsively to different screen sizes.

## Landing Page Structure
- Header with navigation  
- 11 sections with project information, skills, and contacts  
- Footer with additional information  
- Mobile menu for smartphone users  

---

## Purpose
This landing page was created as a demonstration of my skills in web development, design, and modern tooling.  
It combines technical expertise (Next.js, React, TypeScript) with creativity (CSS, Canvas, and 3D animations).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
